## üíª Apex Development

### Apex Class: LaptopBookingHandler
The class handles email notifications when a booking is made:

apex
public class LaptopBookingHandler {
    public static void sendEmailNotification(List<Laptop_Bookings__c> lapList) {
        for (Laptop_Bookings__c lap : lapList) {
            Messaging.SingleEmailMessage email = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
            email.setToAddresses(new List<String>{lap.Email__c});
            email.setSubject('Welcome to Laptop Rentals');
            String body = 'Dear ' + lap.Name + ',\n' +
                          'Thank you for renting with us! Your laptop details are as follows:\n' +
                          'Laptop Amount: ' + lap.Amount__c + '\n' +
                          'Core Type: ' + lap.core_type__c + '\n' +
                          'Laptop Type: ' + lap.Laptop_type__c;
            email.setPlainTextBody(body);
            Messaging.sendEmail(new List<Messaging.SingleEmailMessage>{email});
        }
    }
}


### Apex Trigger: LaptopBooking
This trigger sends email notifications after a booking is created or updated:

apex
trigger LaptopBooking on Laptop_Bookings__c (after insert, after update) {
    if (Trigger.isAfter && (Trigger.isInsert || Trigger.isUpdate)) {
        LaptopBookingHandler.sendEmailNotification(Trigger.new);
    }
}
